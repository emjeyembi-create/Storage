Mark's Portfolio – Final Project

This repository contains my personal portfolio website developed as part of my Final Project for the BS Computer Science program.
The website showcases my background, achievements, skills, projects, and contact information through a modern, responsive, and interactive design.

In addition to being a public portfolio, the system includes user authentication (Login and Register) and CRUD functionality, demonstrating both frontend and backend web development skills.
